# Memento

This is simple tool for save scumming, written in an evening. .Net Framefwork 4.8 is required.

It is not tested very well and it would probably fail horribly in any deviation form ideal scenario, for example, path permissions are not checked, so if a file or folder is inaccessible the program will crash.

Usage is straight forward:
- Create a new profile for the game
- Specify game save folder and game executable and a few options
- Select "Start watching" for the program to start monitoring the save folder and making copies whenever there is a change

That's about it. The program does not prune old saves, so if unchecked, it can get out of control soon - please do it manually
Also it's possible to do manual back up / restore instead of watching.

Please make sure that when you are restoring the game is not running, it's probably not programmed to withstand save changes on the fly.
